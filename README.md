# Determinant-Calculator
 Calculate determinant for n√ón matrix using Laplace expansion with parallelization.

The matrix is in "data.in", it will be read line by line until filling the n*n matrix. The multi-thread is for Unix/Linux operating system, if you are using Windows, you had better change it.

This program will run really slow to get the answer for the big matrix, but it can notably speed up your fan .
